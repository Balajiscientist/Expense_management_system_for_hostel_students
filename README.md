# Expense Management System for Hostel Students

 Hostel students often struggle to manage their limited monthly budgets because they lack personalised tools for tracking daily expenses, shared costs, and upcoming dues.

# ðŸŽ¯ Objectives 
- Designed a student-friendly interface to simplify daily expense tracking
- Enabled categorisation of personal and shared expenses
- Integrated reminders for upcoming payments (mess, rent, etc.)
- Developed visual dashboards for spending analysis
- Ensured data storage and retrieval using a secure backend (e.g., MySQL)
- Enhanced financial awareness and budgeting habits among students
